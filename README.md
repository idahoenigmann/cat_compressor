# cat_compressor
This projects goal is to compress images using a neural network. By the "fallen over 
hourglass" shape of the neural network, we hope to be able to produce new images by
feeding some (random?) data into the middle of the neural network. Btw everything will
be done using images of cats.

### current plan

1. build a cat detector
2. build a cat cropper
3. build a cat compressor
4. build a cat generator

### additional things needed

* lots of images of cats
* losts of images of stuff that is not a cat
* python script for cropping cat faces out of images containing cats
* a better plan
* motivation to write a good readme.md
* more knowledge about neural networks
